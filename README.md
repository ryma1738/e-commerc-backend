## Installation
 In order to install the project download the files and navigate to them in command prompt. Next you will need to type npm i, next you will need to open up your mysql terminal and type source db/schema.sql. After that exit your sql terminal and type npm run seed to populate the data base. To get the data base started you will need to add a .env file with you sql information (reference the config/connection file for variable names).Lastly turn on the app by typing npm start

## Usage
Once you have started the app you can make api calls at what every site you have it implanted. This by default is http://localhost:3001/api/"tags/ categories/ products/". by adding a parameter of an index value you can select a specific item from the api and each has a get, post, put, and delete route
